2. DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT:

What happens when you are new to a place, don’t know anyone and need a help? Can you go around, ask for help and trust their answers too? Find my buddy is a solution to all these problems! You can find buddies near you to get help with the queries that you may have about the new place.

1.       See available buddies near you on map, making it easier to understand who you need to contact.

2.       See buddies only if they are from your country or have at least one common language that you speak. (Our small try to solve trust and communication issues here.)

4.       Have a chat history stored in case you want to keep in touch with them.

5.       Update profile when you learn a new language or have any updates!

6.       If you are a buddy for someone else, don’t worry, your identity is protected because person asking for your help can only see your nickname (which you choose!).
